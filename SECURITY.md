# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you've found a vulnerability or a potential vulnerability in open-appsec please let us know at [security-alert@openappsec.io](mailto:security-alert@openappsec.io). We'll send a confirmation email to acknowledge your report within 24 hours, and we'll send an additional email when we've identified the issue positively or negatively.

A process will be activated upon determining the validity of a reported security vulnerability, which will end with releasing a fix and deciding on the applicable disclosure actions. The reporter of the issue will receive updates of this process' progress.
